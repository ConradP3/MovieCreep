# Movie Creep Usage
Movie Creep is an app that allows users to create a profile to track shows/movies they watch and share with others with ease. 

After watching a movie the user can add it to their movies watch list, or if they have not watched a movie they can add it to their planned movies. They can also add a review of the movie, along with which source they used to watch the movie. This is a social app, friends can add each other and examine others profiles and see what movies they have previously watched and their reviews of the movies on a main feed. There will also be a page for notifications, where users can see who has added them as a friend. Users can manually find movie recommendations based on authentic, trusted reviews from their friends. There will be a specific page for recommendations, which will show the userâ€™s watched movies in order of most recommended.
